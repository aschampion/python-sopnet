	// The big picture: Create a working problem from a set of segments, dump it 
	// as subproblems, solve it with SCALAR, read solution, map it back to 
	// segments.
	//
	// Later, the working problem is just a part of the global problem and is 
	// decomposed into only a few subproblems for consolidation. SCALAR tries to 
	// solve them. SCALAR subproblem variable ids are volatile and are only 
	// known to SCALAR.  Thus, we cannot have a warm start if the same 
	// subproblem is involved another time (which will be very likely) -- at 
	// least not trivially.  Hence, it would be nice if the subproblem state 
	// could be stored independent of the SCALAR subproblem variables, in a map 
	// with the subproblem hash (from all involved global segment ids) as key.  
	// If the SCALAR subproblem is created the same way to yield the same ILP 
	// every time, then we can re-use the previous solver state.  That sounds 
	// feasible.
	//
	// More specific:
	//
	//   Global problem - this is the problem for the whole stack. Doesn't fit 
	//   into the memory, we never see it at once. Variables are implicitly 
	//   represented as segments, which have a globally unique id.
	//
	//   Partial problem - subset of the global problem. Grows as more and more 
	//   of the global problem is explored. Eventually, will not fit into the 
	//   memory. No need to see it at once. Variables are implicitly represented 
	//   as segments, which have a globally unique id.
	//
	//   Working problem - this is a part of the huge problem of variable size.  
	//   Fits into the memory, but might be too big to be solved at once. Runs 
	//   like a sliding window over the global problem to grow the partial 
	//   problem. Variables are contigous sequences in [0,...,n-1] (n number of 
	//   variables in working problem).  Constraints and mapping to segment ids 
	//   are converted/created on demand.
	//
	//   Subproblem - a part of a working problem of constant size. One 
	//   subproblem is assumed to be solvable at once. Variables are subsets of 
	//   [0,...,n] (n number of variables in working problem).
	//
	// What happens:
	//
	//   User selects working problem. Working problem is decomposed into 
	//   subproblems.  Subproblems are solved with SCALAR, result is presented 
	//   as solution to working problem. Solution is stored as solution to 
	//   partial problem.
	//
	//   User augments partial problem. New part and overlapping previous 
	//   subproblems are new working problem.  New subproblems are created.  
	//   Previous subproblems are re-created (and their state is restored for 
	//   the ILP solver). Solved with SCALAR, result augments global solution. 
	//   Ideally, it is not necessary to re-create and re-evaluate more previous 
	//   subproblems.


	// According to our nomenclature, what we get here as _objective, 
	// _constraints, and _configuration is a working problem.
	//
	// We decompose the working problem into subproblems. Variable ids are kept, 
	// thus they are non-contigous for the subproblems. Data structure 
	// LinearObjective is not made for that, but we don't need it if we dump the 
	// problem on-the-fly.
	//
	// Basically, we annotate each constraint with subproblem numbers and create 
	// the SCALAR dump from that. What we need: all involved variables (these 
	// are all variables in the working problem), subproblem numbers for each 
	// contraint and each unary term (of which we have one per variable).
